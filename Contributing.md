# Contributing Guide

You can directly edit(add/delete/modift) the [README.md](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/README.md) file for contributions. 
If you don't know how to edit the file, please leave a message to the [Issue board](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/issues). 

## Awesome list criteria

- **2016** :  Based on discussions
- **2015** :  +100 citations (:sparkles: +200)
- **2014** :  +200 citations (:sparkles: +400)
- **2013** :  +300 citations (:sparkles: +600)
- **2012** :  +400 citations (:sparkles: +800)
- **2011** :  +500 citations (:sparkles: +1000)
- **2010** :  +600 citations (:sparkles: +1200)

This criteria is not a strict baseline, but a **flexible guideline** for being added to the awesome list. (Since the number of citations is affected by the research area, some papers under the threshold may be added to the list while some over the threshold may not.) 

Please add important papers to the awesome list as well as delete some papers if they are considered as out-of-date. Sparkling marks :sparkles: for outstanding papers also need to be updated as increasing number of citations.  

**Please provide a enough description** when you push your contributions.

Thank you.

Terry
